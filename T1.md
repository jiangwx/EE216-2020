# Vivado Tutorial
You can download Vivado from https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html, we recommend you to download SDSoC 2019.1 since it will be used in later session.

## Introduction
In our lab, we will guide you to create a simple digital design using Xilinx Vivado software. A typical digital design flow consists of creating new projects, adding source design file, analyzing behavioral simulation, RTL analysis, synthesis, adding constraints, implementation, timing simulation，generating bitstream and configuring FPGA. You will go through the typical design flow targeting the Zynq-7000 All
Programmable SoC based ZedBoard. The typical design flow is shown below. We focus on the first three steps in this tutorial.

## General Flow
### Create A New Project
1. Open Vivado by selecting Start > All Programs > Xilinx Design Tools > Vivado 2019.2 >Vivado 2019.2
2. Click Create New Project to start the wizard. You will see Create A New Vivado Project dialog box. Click Next.

9. Save the file

```

module top(
    input a,
    input b,
    output [5:0] x
    );
assign x[0] = a | b;
assign x[1] = a |(~b);
assign x[2] = a ^ b;
assign x[3] = a ^(~b);
assign x[4] = a & b;
assign x[5] = a &(~b);
endmodule

```

### Behavioral Simulation
1. Click Add Sources under the Project Manager tasks of the Flow Navigator pane.

8. Double click the new created source file testbench and open it. Then you can type in the test code.
  
  ![image](pic/T1/23.PNG)

9. Save the file.
  
```verilog
module testbench();
reg a;
reg b;
wire [5:0] x;
top uut_top(
.a(a),
.b(b),
.x(x));
initial
begin
a = 0;
b = 0;
#10;
a = 0;
b = 1;
#10;
a = 1;
b = 0;
#10;
a = 1;
b = 1;
#10;
end
endmodule
```

10. Select Simulation Settings under the Project Manager tasks of the Flow Navigator pane. A Project Settings form will appear showing the Simulation properties form.
